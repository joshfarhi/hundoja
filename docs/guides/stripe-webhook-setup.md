# Stripe Webhook Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up Stripe webhooks to automatically update order payment status in your database when payments succeed or fail.

## Why Webhooks Are Needed

When a customer completes payment, your application needs to:

1. Update the order status from "pending" to "processing"
2. Change payment status from "pending" to "paid"
3. Trigger any post-payment processes (emails, inventory updates, etc.)

Webhooks ensure this happens reliably, even if the customer closes their browser before returning to your site.

## Step 1: Create Webhook Endpoint in Stripe Dashboard

### 1.1 Access Stripe Dashboard

1. Go to [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/)
2. Navigate to **Developers** â†’ **Webhooks**
3. Click **"Add endpoint"**

### 1.2 Configure Webhook URL

**For Development (localhost):**

```url
http://localhost:3000/api/webhooks/stripe
```

**For Production:**

```url
https://yourdomain.com/api/webhooks/stripe
```

> **Note**: For localhost testing, you'll need to use Stripe CLI for forwarding (see Step 3)

### 1.3 Select Events

You're currently on the "Select events" step. Choose these specific events:

#### Required Events:
- âœ… `payment_intent.succeeded` - When payment completes successfully
- âœ… `payment_intent.payment_failed` - When payment fails

#### Optional Events (for enhanced functionality):
- `payment_intent.canceled` - When payment is canceled
- `payment_intent.requires_action` - When additional authentication needed
- `charge.dispute.created` - When customer disputes a charge

### 1.4 Event Selection Process:
1. Click **"Select events"** 
2. Search for "payment_intent"
3. Select the checkboxes for:
   - `payment_intent.succeeded`
   - `payment_intent.payment_failed`
4. Click **"Add events"**

### 1.5 Choose Destination Type
- Select **"Connect to your server"** (not Connect applications)

### 1.6 Configure Your Destination  
- **Endpoint URL**: Enter your webhook URL from step 1.2
- **Description**: "Order payment status updates"
- Click **"Add endpoint"**

## Step 2: Get Your Webhook Secret

After creating the webhook:

1. Click on your newly created webhook endpoint
2. In the **"Signing secret"** section, click **"Reveal"**
3. Copy the webhook secret (starts with `whsec_`)
4. Add it to your `.env.local` file:

```env
# Add this to your .env.local file
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_secret_key_here
```

## Step 3: Local Development Setup (Stripe CLI)

For testing webhooks locally, use Stripe CLI:

### 3.1 Install Stripe CLI
```bash
# macOS (using Homebrew)
brew install stripe/stripe-cli/stripe

# Or download from: https://github.com/stripe/stripe-cli/releases
```

### 3.2 Login to Stripe CLI
```bash
stripe login
```

### 3.3 Forward Webhooks to Localhost
```bash
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/webhooks/stripe
```

This will output a webhook secret like:
```
whsec_1234567890abcdef...
```

Use this secret in your `.env.local` for development.

## Step 4: Environment Variables Setup

Add these to your `.env.local` file:

```env
# Stripe Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...

# Webhook Secret (from Step 2 or 3)
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...

# Optional: Webhook URL (for reference)
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_URL=http://localhost:3000/api/webhooks/stripe
```

## Step 5: Test Your Webhook

### 5.1 Test Payment Flow
1. Start your development server: `npm run dev`
2. If using Stripe CLI: Run `stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/webhooks/stripe` in another terminal
3. Make a test purchase through your checkout
4. Check your console logs for webhook receipt

### 5.2 Verify Database Updates
After a successful test payment, check your database:

```sql
-- Check if order status was updated
SELECT order_number, status, payment_status, created_at 
FROM orders 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 5;
```

You should see:
- `status` changed from "pending" to "processing"
- `payment_status` changed from "pending" to "paid"

### 5.3 Test with Stripe CLI (Alternative)
```bash
# Trigger a test webhook event
stripe trigger payment_intent.succeeded
```

## Step 6: Production Deployment

### 6.1 Update Webhook URL
1. Go back to Stripe Dashboard â†’ Webhooks
2. Edit your webhook endpoint
3. Update URL to your production domain:
   ```
   https://yourdomain.com/api/webhooks/stripe
   ```

### 6.2 Production Environment Variables
Ensure your production environment has:
```env
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...  # Live secret key
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_... # Production webhook secret
```

### 6.3 SSL Certificate
- Stripe requires HTTPS for production webhooks
- Verify your SSL certificate is properly configured

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

#### 1. "Webhook signature verification failed"
- **Cause**: Wrong webhook secret
- **Solution**: Double-check `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in `.env.local`

#### 2. "Connection timeout" 
- **Cause**: Server not responding or wrong URL
- **Solution**: Verify webhook URL and server status

#### 3. "No such payment_intent"
- **Cause**: Database lookup failing
- **Solution**: Check `stripe_payment_intent_id` field in orders table

#### 4. "Headers not found" error
- **Cause**: Fixed in your current code
- **Solution**: Ensure you're using `await headers()` in webhook route

### Debugging Tips:

#### 1. Enable Webhook Logs
```typescript
// Add to your webhook route for debugging
console.log('Webhook received:', {
  type: event.type,
  id: event.id,
  payment_intent: event.data.object.id
});
```

#### 2. Check Stripe Dashboard
- Go to Webhooks â†’ Your endpoint â†’ Attempt logs
- Review failed attempts and error messages

#### 3. Test with curl
```bash
# Test webhook endpoint manually
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/webhooks/stripe \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"test": true}'
```

## Webhook Event Flow

Here's what happens when a payment succeeds:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Customer
    participant Your App
    participant Stripe
    participant Database

    Customer->>Your App: Complete checkout
    Your App->>Stripe: Create payment intent
    Stripe->>Customer: Process payment
    Customer->>Stripe: Payment succeeds
    Stripe->>Your App: Send webhook (payment_intent.succeeded)
    Your App->>Database: Update order status to "processing"
    Your App->>Database: Update payment_status to "paid"
    Your App->>Stripe: Return 200 OK
```

## Security Best Practices

1. **Always verify webhook signatures** (already implemented)
2. **Use HTTPS in production** (required by Stripe)
3. **Handle idempotency** - webhooks may be sent multiple times
4. **Return 200 status quickly** - avoid timeouts
5. **Log webhook events** for debugging and monitoring

## Next Steps

After webhook setup:
1. âœ… Test the complete payment flow
2. âœ… Verify order status updates in admin panel
3. âœ… Monitor webhook delivery in Stripe Dashboard
4. ðŸ”„ Set up email notifications for successful orders
5. ðŸ”„ Implement inventory management triggers
6. ðŸ”„ Add order confirmation emails

Your webhook is now configured to keep your order management system in sync with Stripe payment events!
